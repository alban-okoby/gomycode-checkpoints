# Advanced Algorithms : Minimum Spanning Trees

## Network Cable Optimization
You're tasked with designing an efficient cable layout to connect several computers in an office. Each connection between computers has a cost based on the cable length. Your goal is to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal’s or Prim’s Algorithm, ensuring all computers are connected with the least total cost and no loops.
